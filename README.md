# Multi-Tenant Zapier Integration Platform - Design Mockup

A simple design mockup showing how a multi-tenant system could handle 100-150 Zapier integrations with per-customer controls.

> **Note**: This is just a visual mockup/proof-of-concept, not a real system.

## ðŸš€ What This Mockup Shows

- **Multi-tenant setup** - Different customers see different integrations
